## Structure

The structure of the project is as follows:
  - [`Makefile`](Makefile), to build, clean, test and verify all solutions.
  - [`euler.rb`](euler.rb), a helper script to check solutions
  - [`src/`](src/), a folder with all the solutions, named as such:
      - [`001-multiples-of-3-and-5/`](src/001-multiples-of-3-and-5), an example 
        of a problem folder
          - [`problem.md`](src/001-multiples-of-3-and-5/problem.md), the
            explanation of the problem
          - [`ruby/`](src/001-multiples-of-3-and-5/ruby/), a ruby implementation
            of the solution
              - [`Makefile`](src/001-multiples-of-3-and-5/ruby/Makefile), the
                Makefile to build, test, run and clean the ruby solution
              - `...` ruby code and files
          - [`rust/`](src/001-multiples-of-3-and-5/rust), a rust implementation of the solution
              - [`Makefile`](src/001-multiples-of-3-and-5/rust/Makefile), the
                Makefile to build, test, run and clean the rust solution
              - `...` rust code and files
          - [`.solution.bcrypt`](src/001-multiples-of-3-and-5/.solution.bcrypt),
            a [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt)ed hash of the
            solution
      - `...` other problems
  - [`lib/`](lib/) — libraries and data shared between solutions
  - [`doc/`](doc/) — folder where, at some point, documentation for my solutions
    can be found or generated.

Every solution needs to contain a
[`Makefile`](src/001-multiples-of-3-and-5/ruby/Makefile) that responds to four
commands:
  - `make build` — to build the solution
  - `make solve` — to solve the problem, which should return the solution on
    `stdout` (and no other text)
  - `make test` — to build and run the unit test suite, returning nonzero on
    failure
  - `make clean` — to clean intermediate files, build targets and caches

Some solutions may have a `DISABLED` file inside their folder. This tells my
euler.rb script to ignore them, which usually means that the solution doesn't
work or is too slow, but I have committed it anyways because I feel that I get
get it to work or optimize it.

## Getting started

  - ruby `2.3`
  - python `3.6`
  - crystal `0.24.1`
  - clang or gcc implementing `c99`
  - rust `1.19.0`

### On macOS

```bash
$ brew install ruby python3 crystal-lang rust
```

## Run Solutions

The [`Makefile`](Makefile) in the project root, in conjunction with the 
[`euler.rb`](euler.rb) script, offer some ways of running the solutions and
showing some statistics. To build, test, verify and time all solutions (this
could take a while), run:

```bash
make check
```

If you want to see how many problems are solved in a more concise manner, run:

```bash
make overview
```

Read the source code of the Makefile for more details.
