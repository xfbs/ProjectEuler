# Goals

What do I want to achieve?

## Problems

- Solve the first 100 problems (without any omissions)

## Languages

  - C (my favourite, although horrible)
  - Ruby (my favourite, although slow)
  - Rust (someone brave dragon slayer needs to put the type checker into it's
    place, but otherwise a good language)
  - Clojure (because if Simon likes it, I should at least do a little with it)
  - Python (haven't used this in a damn long while)
  - Haskell (I'm really bad at it, needs work)
  - OCaml (because it seems to be popular, and hey it's functional)
  - Assembler (because why the fuck not, at least for a couple of problems)
