# Problem 36: Double-base palindromes

![p336](img/036.gif)

The decimal number, 585 = 10010010012 (binary), is palindromic in both
bases. Find the sum of all numbers, less than one million, which are
palindromic in base 10 and base 2. (Please note that the palindromic
number, in either base, may not include leading zeros.)
